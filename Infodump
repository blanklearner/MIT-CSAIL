thoughts

Does it make sense to merge according to weights of top n rendering of estimated pose 

what are the different ways this process can be made better , priority of different types(computing speed,efficiency, equipment required, 

what are the bottlenecks in the system 

what are the recent developments which can help

Real time environment 3D model making , this applied for new construction of places/building/etc for augmented reality games,and places. 

Thoughts

new games and AR coming up will require pov 1st person data and models . Check and research about this , kumar/nikhil /amrit/shreyam/ adarsh/
